== Introduction

=== FAQ

[qanda]
*What is it?*::

This is an External Module that allows REDCap administrators to create and manage *Security Access Groups* in a REDCap system.

*What are Security Access Groups?*::

*Security Access Groups* (SAGs) are used to restrict which user rights a REDCap user can be granted in a project. SAGs do not define the rights a user will have in a given project; rather, they define the set of allowable rights the user is able to be granted. SAGs are defined at the system level and are used in any project that has this module enabled.

*When would that be useful?*::

For example, if your institution requires documentation of training for users to export data, you can create a SAG that does not allow the "Data Export Tool" User Right to be granted to users assigned it. Once a user completes training, they can be moved to a SAG that does allow the "Data Export Tool" User Right to be granted. +
 +
In other words, you may want to provide different tiers of training to your users and only allow specific project-level user rights to users who have completed the appropriate training. Although this module does not administer or track training, it does handle eveything else.

*Isn't it the study team's responsibility to manage user rights?*::
Yes and no. *_As system administrators, we have the responsibility to ensure users of our system are adequately trained for the jobs they'll be doing._* Many users do not want to complete an hours-long training if they will only be entering data in a data collection instrument. You can give those users a shorter, focused training and assign them to a SAG that allows minimal user rights.

=== How do you use the module?

REDCap administrators first create SAGs using a <<security_access_groups_tab, menu>> in the Control Center. Once a SAG is created, users can be assigned to it in another <<users_tab, tab>> of the same control center menu. When a user is assigned to a SAG, the user will only be able to be granted User Rights that are allowed by the SAG.

IMPORTANT: The module must be enabled in a project for it to restrict User Rights in that project. It is recommended that the module be enabled in all projects.

When the module is enabled in a project, it will check which rights are allowable for a user according to their SAG before granting any user rights to that user. The module intercepts all attempts to set user rights in a project, including

* Using the usual methods on the User Rights project page
* Using the *Upload users, role, and assignments* feature on the User Rights project page
* Using the REDCap API

*All attempts to set user rights will be blocked if the user is not allowed to be granted the rights according to their SAG.* Attempts to circumvent the module are detected and logged.

[TIP]
====
The module ignores users who are currently expired in the project. This allows the user to remain in the project but prevents them from using their noncompliant user rights until those noncompliant rights are removed. The user can then be un-expired. 

The module provides a convenient way to expire users in a project on the <<project_status_tab, Project Status tab>>.

== Module Configuration

=== Default Email Settings

The control center module configuration page allows admins to set the default values for all alerts that can be sent to users and user rights holders from the <<project_status_tab, project status page>>. 

This is a convenient way to get up and running when you first enable the module, because many users likely will need to be notified.

[#user_rights_holders_tab]
[#reports_tab]
=== Reports Tab

.Reports tab
image::cc_report_types.png[reports]

This tab provides an easy way to see all users in the system that currently have user rights that do not comply with their current SAG. This can occur when the module is first enabled in a project or when a user is assigned to a new SAG.

The report options are as follows:

[#reports_table]
[%header,cols="1,3"]
|===
|Report title
|Description

|Users with Noncompliant Rights (non-expired)
|This report lists all users who are assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in a project. This report only includes users if they are not currently expired in the project(s).

|Users with Noncompliant Rights (all)
|This report lists all users who are assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in a project. This report includes all users, regardless of whether they are currently expired in the project(s).

|Projects with Noncompliant Rights (non-expired)
|This report lists all projects that have at least one user who is assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in the project. This report only includes users who have a non-expired user account.

|Projects with Noncompliant Rights (all)
|This report lists all projects that have at least one user who is assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in the project. This report includes all users, regardless of whether their user account is expired.

|Users and Projects with Noncompliant Rights (non-expired)
|This report lists every user and project combination in which the user is assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in the project. This report only includes users who are not currently expired in the project.

|Users and Projects with Noncompliant Rights (all)
|This report lists every user and project combination in which the user is assigned to a SAG that does not allow the user to be granted all of the rights they currently have in the project. This report includes all users, regardless of whether they are currently expired in the project.
|===

.Report example
image::cc_report_example.png[report example]

TIP: You can filter based on project status by including "project_status=" and then the status you want to filter on. For example, to only include projects that are in Production, you would use `project_status=Production`. To only include projects that are Completed, you would use `project_status=Completed`. To include both Production and Development projects, you would use `project_status=Production | project_status=Development`. See the <<searching>> section for more information.

endif::[]

[#project_page]
== Project Page

[#project_status_tab]
=== Project Status Tab

The module adds a page that shows the status of all users in the project. The status of each user is determined by the user's SAG and the rights they have in the project. The color of the row indicates whether the user is:

* Green - compliant with their SAG
* Red - non-compliant with their SAG
* Grey - expired in the project

You can also check the *Noncompliant Rights* column to see which rights the user has that are not allowed by their SAG.

TIP: If you want to see only users who inappropriately have particular rights, you can use the search box. For example, if you are only interested in the **User Rights** and/or *Project Design and Setup* rights, type `"user rights" | "project design"` in the search box. See the <<searching>> section for more information.

.Project status tab
image::p_status.png[project status]

TIP: If there are any users that are non-compliant with their SAG, you can use one of the *Action* buttons to send an email to the user, the user's rights holders, or both. You can also expire the user from the project. An alert can optionally be sent to the user and/or the user's rights holders when the user is expired.

[#placeholders]
==== Placeholders

The following placeholders can be used in the email subject and body fields in alerts:

[%header,cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Placeholder
|Audience
|Description

.^a|`[sag-user]`
.^|Project User
| The user's username

.^a|`[sag-user-fullname]`
.^|Project User
|The user's full name

.^a|`[sag-user-email]`
.^|Project User
|The user's email address

.^a|`[sag-user-sag]`
.^|Project User
|The user's current security access group

.^a|`[sag-rights]`
.^|Project User
|A formatted list of the rights that do not
conform with the user's security access group.

.^a|`[sag-project-title]`
.^|Any
|The title of the project

.^a|`[sag-users]`
.^|User Rights Holders
|A formatted list of usernames

.^a|`[sag-user-emails]`
.^|User Rights Holders
|A formatted list of user emails

.^a|`[sag-user-sags]`
.^|User Rights Holders
|A formatted list of users' current security access groups

.^a|`[sag-users-table]`
.^|User Rights Holders
|A formatted table of usernames, full names, email addresses, and SAGs

.^a|`[sag-users-table-full]`
.^|User Rights Holders
|A formatted table of usernames, full names, email addresses, SAGs, and non-compliant rights

.^a|`[sag-expiration-date]`
.^|Any (only available in User Expiration alerts)
|The date the user will be expired from the project

|===

TIP: You can also use any REDCap Smart Variables, although few will be relevant in this context.

[#alert_log_tab]
=== Alert Log Tab

The module provides a table of all alerts sent and scheduled in the project. 

TIP: Scheduled reminders can be canceled from this tab.

.Alert log tab
image::p_alert_log.png[alert log]


.Alert preview example
image::p_logs_preview.png[alert preview]

TIP: Use the search bar to search for the text of an alert, the username of the user the alert is about, or the username of the user the alert is being sent to, and more. See the <<searching>> section for more information.

[#user_rights_tab]

[#logging]
=== Logging

One of the benefits of using this module is the enhanced logging it provides. The module creates detailed logs in the 
project's own logs for all changes to user rights, including

* When a user is added to a project with custom rights
* When a user is added to a project in an existing User Role
* When a user's rights are changed
* When a role's rights definition is changed
* When a user is added/removed from a user role
* When users are imported into a project via CSV
* When a user's rights are changed via CSV import
* When roles are imported into a project via CSV
* When a user is assigned to a role via CSV import
* When a user is added to a project via the API

[#translation]
== Translation (i18n / l10n)

=== General Information

The module is capable of being translated into languages other than English via the External Module Framework's language
selection feature. To set the language for the module system-wide, go to Control Center > External Modules > Manage 
External Modules and click the "Configure" button for the module. Then select the language you want to use from the 
"Language" dropdown and click "Save".

You can override the system-wide language at the project level by visiting the Project Module Manager and clicking the
"Configure" button for the module. Then select the language you want to use from the "Language" dropdown and click 
"Save".

IMPORTANT: There are parts of the module that are not translated by the module itself, but instead rely on REDCap's
built-in language translation system. These include the names of the user rights and associated descriptions.

=== Available Translations

These languages are currently available to be used in the module:

* English ([.notranslate]#default#)
* Arabic ([.notranslate]#ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä#)
* Bangla ([.notranslate]#‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ#)
* Chinese ([.notranslate]#‰∏≠Êñá#)
* French ([.notranslate]#Fran√ßais#)
* German ([.notranslate]#Deutsch#)
* Hindi ([.notranslate]#‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä#)
* Italian ([.notranslate]#Italiana#)
* Portuguese ([.notranslate]#Portugu√™s#)
* Spanish ([.notranslate]#Espa√±ol#)
* Ukrainian ([.notranslate]#—É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞#)
* Urdu ([.notranslate]#ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà#)

=== Limitations

==== Right-to-Left Languages

Currently there is limited support for RTL lanuages. The module will display RTL languages correctly, but the 
structure/formatting of UI elements will still be LTR. There are options for more fully supporting RTL, but this will be
low priority unless we hear from groups that need this feature.

=== Translating the Module

The translations provided with the module were created using automatic translation software and may not be accurate. If 
you would like to correct a translation or contribute a new translation, please follow the instructions below.

==== Creating a new translation

If you want to translate the module into a new language, first https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo[fork] the `main` branch of the module's https://github.com/AndrewPoppe/Security-Access-Groups[Github repository]. Next, follow these steps:

1. Find the `lang` directory in the module's source code.
2. Copy the `English.ini` file and change the name of the copy to the language you want to translate to. Name the file 
with the English name for the language (capitalized) followed by the language's endonym (using that language's glyphs) 
in parentheses. For example, if you want to translate the module into Japanese, you would name the file 
`Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û).ini`.
3. Open the file you just created in a text editor and translate the text on the right side of the equal sign for each
line. For example, if you wanted to translate the text `Introduction` into Japanese, you would change the line
`status_ui_3 = "Introduction"` to `status_ui_3 = "Â∫èÁ´†"`.
4. Repeat the process for each line.
5. Save the file and upload it to the "lang" folder of the module's source code.
6. Submit a pull request with your changes to the `main` branch of the 
https://github.com/AndrewPoppe/Security-Access-Groups[Github repository].


==== Correcting an existing translation

If you want to correct an existing translation, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Find the `lang` directory in the module's source code.
2. Open the file for the language you want to correct in a text editor.
3. Correct the text on the right side of the equal sign for each line you want to change.
4. Save the file and upload it to the "lang" folder of the module's source code.
5. Submit a pull request with your changes to the `main` branch of the 
https://github.com/AndrewPoppe/Security-Access-Groups[Github repository].

[#miscellaneous]
== Miscellaneous

[#searching]
=== Searching

==== General

Many of the tables in the module have a search box that can be used to filter the table. The search box will search all columns in the table. 

For example, if you want to find all users that are currently assigned to the SAG whose label has the word [.notranslate]#'Nothing'# in it, you can type [.notranslate]#'Nothing'# in the search box and the table will be filtered to only show rows that have the text [.notranslate]#'Nothing'# in any column.

.Searching example
image::searching_example.png[searching example]

==== "AND" Searches

By default, the search box will be an 'AND' seach, meaning that it will split your search term into separate words and only show results that match all of those search words. For example, if you type [.notranslate]#'joe admin'# in the search box, the table will be filtered to only show rows with BOTH [.notranslate]#'joe'# AND [.notranslate]#'admin'# in any column. It *will not* show rows that have _either_ [.notranslate]#'joe'# _or_ [.notranslate]#'admin'# but it *will* show rows that have e.g., [.notranslate]#'admin'# in column 1 and [.notranslate]#'joe'# in column 2.

.AND example
image::searching_example_AND.png[searching example AND]


==== "OR" Searches

If you want to show all rows that match one value OR match another value, you have to use an "OR" search.

You can use the "|" operator to search for multiple terms like this in an either/or manner. For example, if you want to find all users with the username [.notranslate]#"alice"# or [.notranslate]#"bob"#, you can type [.notranslate]#"alice | bob"# in the search box and the table will be filtered to only show users with [.notranslate]#"alice"# or [.notranslate]#"bob"# in any column.

TIP: including the '|' symbol has the side effect of making the search a Regular Expression search (see <<regular_expression_searches, below>>).

.OR example
image::searching_example_OR.png[searching example OR]

==== Exact Phrase Searches

If you want to filter based on a phrase, you can out your phrase in double quotes. For example, if you want to find all rows with the exact phrase [.notranslate]#'joe admin'# you can type [.notranslate]#'"joe admin"'# in the search box and the table will be filtered to only show rows with [.notranslate]#'joe admin'# in any column.

.Exact phrase example
image::searching_example_exact_phrase.png[searching example exact phrase]

[#regular_expression_searches]
==== Regular Expression Searches

By including a '|' character anywhere in your search term, your search turns into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression[Regular Expression^] search. This allows you to compose complex searches that are not possible with the default search.

.*Regular Expression example* - showing all rows where a [.notranslate]#"d"# is followed by any number of letters and then an [.notranslate]#"n"# - as in [.notranslate]#"admin"# and [.notranslate]#"dan"#

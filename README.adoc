== Introduction

This module allows admins to create and manage Security Access Groups (SAGs) that restrict which User Rights a user may be granted. 

For example, if your institution requires documentation of training for users to export data, you can create a SAG that does not allow the "Data Export Tool" User Right to be granted to users assigned it. Once a user completes training, they can be moved to a SAG that does allow the "Data Export Tool" User Right to be granted.

To accomplish this, REDCap administrators first create SAGs using a menu in the Control Center. Once a SAG is created, users can be assigned to it in the same control center menu. When a user is assigned to a SAG, the user will only be able to be granted User Rights that are allowed by the SAG.

NOTE: The module must be enabled in a project for it to restrict User Rights in that project. It is recommended that the module be enabled in all projects.

When the module is enabled in a project, it will check which rights are allowable for a user according to their SAG before granting any user rights to that user. The module intercepts all attempts to set user rights in a project, including

* Using the usual methods on the User Rights project page
* Using the `Upload users, role, and assignments` feature on the User Rights project page
* Using the REDCap API

*All attempts to set user rights will be blocked if the user is not allowed to be granted the rights according to their SAG.* Attempts to circumvent the module are detected and logged.
